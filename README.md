Data Representation and Querying Christmas Project based on MEAN (MongoDB Express.js Angular 6 Node.js).
For this porject I created a GMIT Casino Application.
The project is composed of 5 components.
The post-create component allows the user to enter their details which are then sent to the server I have set up on mLab.
The post-details component allows all the users saved to the server to be viewed.
From here you can either edit or delete the user details.
The post-edit component allows any of the information except the password to be changed and saved to the server.
The memberships component displays a page with all the differnt memberships available and their benefits.
